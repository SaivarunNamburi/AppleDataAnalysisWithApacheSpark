# Apple Transactions Analysis with PySpark on Databricks

This project demonstrates the construction of ETL pipelines using PySpark on Databricks. It showcases data ingestion from various sources (CSV, Parquet, Delta Table), leverages the Factory Pattern for flexible reader creation, and employs PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL for business logic implementation. Data is loaded into both a Data Lake and a Data Lakehouse for analysis purposes. The project also highlights commonly encountered PySpark problems, including broadcast joins, partitioning and bucketing, window functions (LAG, LEAD), Delta tables.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

* ETL Pipelines with PySpark
* Factory Pattern
* PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL
* Data Lake and Data Lakehouse

## Implementation, Transformation, and Analysis Steps

This project follows an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach:

**1. Data Source Ingestion**

- Utilize PySpark to read data from CSV, Parquet, and Delta Table sources using the Factory Pattern for reader object creation.
- Configure appropriate file paths or Delta table locations for data access.

**2. Data Transformation**

- Apply PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL for data cleaning, filtering, and shaping operations to prepare the data for analysis.
- Examples could include:
    * Handling missing values or invalid data.
    * Deriving new columns or features from existing data.
    * Filtering data based on specific criteria.

**3. Business Logic and Analysis**

- Implement the core analysis tasks using PySpark functions:
    * **Identify customers who purchased both iPhone and AirPods:** Use filtering and joins to isolate these customers.
    * **Find customers who bought only iPhone and AirPods:** Refine the filtering to select customers who didn't purchase other products.
    * **List products bought after initial purchase:** Use window functions like LAG or LEAD to track subsequent purchases.
    * **Calculate average time delay between iPhone and Airpod purchases:** Leverage window functions and timestamps.
    * **Determine top 3 selling products in each category:** Utilize grouping, aggregation (e.g., `sum`), and sorting operations.

**4. Data Loading**

- Save the transformed data to both a Data Lake (e.g., raw data format) and a Data Lakehouse (e.g., curated data format) using Delta tables or other suitable storage options.

## Additional Considerations

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential data ingestion or processing issues.
* **Scalability:** Consider techniques like partitioning and bucketing to optimize data access patterns for large datasets.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests to ensure the correctness and consistency of your ETL pipelines and analysis logic.

## Further Enhancement

* **Code Documentation:** Add clear and concise comments within the code to enhance readability and maintainability.
* **Job Scheduling:** Explore tools like Apache Airflow or Databricks Workflows to schedule ETL pipelines for automated execution.

## Conclusion

This project provides a solid foundation for building ETL pipelines and performing data analysis using PySpark on Databricks. It showcases essential techniques and delves into LLD. By incorporating the suggestions above, we can further strengthen the project's structure, maintainability, and robustness.
